NHL Racing Line Chart - Feature Implementation Summary
========================================================

This document summarizes the feature requests and implementations for the NHL racing line chart project. Use this as a reference for similar projects or when adding new features.

## Original Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with controls and chart container
- `line-chart-race.js` - Main JavaScript file containing LineChartRace class
- `all_data.json` - NHL player data by date (unordered JSON with daily stats)

## Feature Requests Implemented

### 1. Data Integration
**Request**: "I added a file to the directory named 'all_data.json'. It has daily data from october to april. The json is not ordered, but each player listed is in order by total number of points. Can you make it so that the project works with this data?"

**Implementation**:
- Created `loadAndTransformData()` function to fetch and parse JSON
- Added date sorting with `Object.keys(rawData).sort((a, b) => new Date(a) - new Date(b))`
- Mapped player data format: `{id: player_${player.playerId}, name: player.skaterFullName, value: player.points}`
- Replaced sample data with real NHL data

### 2. Weekly Data Aggregation
**Request**: "Can we add an option to make this weekly datapoints instead of using the ones that are every day"

**Implementation**:
- Added `aggregateToWeekly()` function that groups data by week (Sunday-Saturday)
- Created dropdown control in HTML: `<select id="view-toggle"><option value="daily">Daily</option><option value="weekly">Weekly</option></select>`
- Modified `loadAndTransformData(viewType)` to accept view parameter
- Added event handler to reinitialize chart when view changes

### 3. Dynamic Y-Axis Scaling
**Request**: "Also, is there an option to dynamically scale the y axis based on the max and min at the time with a buffer, making sure it can't go below 0"

**Implementation**:
- Added `this.isDynamicScale = true` property
- Created `updateYScale(timeIndex)` method that:
  - Calculates min/max from visible data (current + historical trail)
  - Ensures minimum never goes below 0: `Math.max(0, minValue * 0.9)`
  - Adds 10% buffer: `maxValue * 1.1`
  - Updates on every frame for smooth scaling

### 4. Label Collision Detection
**Request**: "Can you think of a good way to handle overlapping names?"

**Implementation**:
- Added `calculateLabelPositions(players)` method with collision detection
- Implements vertical offset algorithm with 20px minimum spacing
- Added leader lines for offset labels using dashed lines
- Compression algorithm when labels exceed chart bounds
- Visual elements: dots, labels, and leader lines all coordinate positions

### 5. Smooth Time Interpolation
**Request**: "can you make the transitions throughout time smoother? I would love for it to feel like it's travelling through time at a consistent rate as opposed to the jumps when moving to the next date."

**Implementation**:
- Added `interpolateData(data)` method creating 30 intermediate frames between data points
- Changed animation from discrete jumps to continuous flow
- Interpolates player values: `currentValue + (nextValue - currentValue) * t`
- Handles players appearing/disappearing in data
- Updated animation timing: `frameDelay = 50ms` with `this.frameDelay * 0.8` transition duration

### 6. X-Axis Improvements
**Request**: "I love the feel of this now. Is there a way to keep the feel of it, however there are a lot of empty tick marks on the x axis now. can the days get compressed together and empty tick marks be removed without that affecting the interpolation?"

**Implementation**:
- Tracked original data indices separately from interpolated frames
- Modified x-axis to only show actual data dates, not interpolated frames
- Added `findClosestOriginalIndex()` helper function
- Maintained smooth interpolation while cleaning up axis display

### 7. Smooth X-Axis Scrolling
**Request**: "With the x axis, it would be great if it scrolled like the y axis does. to make everything look smoother"

**Implementation**:
- Created clipping path for x-axis: `<clipPath id="x-axis-clip">`
- Added inner transformation group for smooth scrolling
- Implemented translation-based movement instead of domain changes
- Synchronized axis movement with interpolation progress
- **Note**: Had to revert initial complex implementation due to jittery behavior

### 8. Dynamic Dot Positioning
**Request**: "I want the dots to be at the red line only after the first 9 points. For the first 9 points, I want the dots to do across the x axis like the axis tick marks move"

**Implementation**:
- Added conditional dot positioning:
  ```javascript
  if (currentOriginalIndex < 9) {
      dotXPosition = currentOriginalIndex * dateInterval;
  } else {
      dotXPosition = this.dotX; // Fixed at red line
  }
  ```
- Updated labels and leader lines to follow dot position
- Modified line generation to connect properly to moving dots

## Technical Patterns Used

### 1. Data Transformation Pattern
```javascript
async function loadAndTransformData(viewType = 'daily') {
    const response = await fetch('all_data.json');
    const rawData = await response.json();
    
    // Sort dates chronologically
    const sortedDates = Object.keys(rawData).sort((a, b) => new Date(a) - new Date(b));
    
    // Transform to expected format
    const transformedData = sortedDates.map(date => ({
        date: date,
        values: rawData[date].map(player => ({
            id: `player_${player.playerId}`,
            name: player.skaterFullName,
            value: player.points
        }))
    }));
    
    return viewType === 'weekly' ? aggregateToWeekly(transformedData) : transformedData;
}
```

### 2. Smooth Interpolation Pattern
```javascript
// Create interpolated frames between data points
for (let j = 1; j < this.framesPerTransition; j++) {
    const t = j / this.framesPerTransition;
    
    // Interpolate values
    if (currentPlayer && nextPlayer) {
        value = currentPlayer.value + (nextPlayer.value - currentPlayer.value) * t;
    }
}
```

### 3. Collision Detection Pattern
```javascript
// Sort by position and adjust overlaps
for (let i = 1; i < sortedPlayers.length; i++) {
    const prev = sortedPlayers[i - 1];
    const curr = sortedPlayers[i];
    
    const minY = prev.labelY + labelHeight;
    if (curr.labelY < minY) {
        curr.labelY = minY;
    }
}
```

### 4. Conditional Animation Pattern
```javascript
// Different behavior for different phases
if (currentOriginalIndex < 9) {
    // Building phase behavior
} else {
    // Scrolling phase behavior
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Variable Scope Conflicts
**Issue**: "Identifier 'currentOriginalIndex' has already been declared"
**Solution**: Reuse variables instead of redeclaring, be careful with `const`/`let` in same scope

### 2. Line Flattening During Scrolling
**Issue**: Historical lines lose shape when x-axis scrolling begins
**Solution**: Maintain original line positioning logic, only change dot positioning

### 3. Jittery Animations
**Issue**: Complex domain/tick manipulation causes stuttering
**Solution**: Use transform translations instead of domain changes for smooth movement

### 4. Alignment Issues
**Issue**: X-axis labels don't align with data points
**Solution**: Use consistent positioning calculations between axis and visual elements

## Best Practices Learned

1. **Incremental Development**: Implement one feature at a time, test thoroughly
2. **Preserve Working Code**: When adding features, isolate changes to avoid breaking existing functionality
3. **Consistent Data Flow**: Use same calculation methods across different visual elements
4. **Performance Considerations**: Limit DOM updates, use efficient transitions
5. **State Management**: Track different phases of animation separately
6. **Error Handling**: Validate data transformations and handle edge cases

### 9. Y-Axis Minimum Based on Visible Historical Trail
**Request**: "Can you make it so that the minimum value in the y axis corresponds with the minimum value in the overall lines present on the chart. Like the earliest date current on the graph?"

**Implementation**:
- Modified `updateYScale()` to calculate min/max from visible historical trail
- Identifies current top players and gets their values across entire visible time range
- For first 9 points: from beginning to current; for sliding window: last 10 original data points
- Ensures y-axis perfectly frames actual visible data for optimal vertical space usage

### 10. 10x Interpolation Between X-Axis Tick Marks
**Request**: "It seems like the data points will only move in the x direction at intervals of 1 tick mark. I want them to move and glide 10 times between tick marks on the x axis. I think interpolating between those spots in both the x and y direction will help"

**Implementation**:
- Reduced `framesPerTransition` from 30 to 10 for optimal gliding between tick marks
- Enhanced interpolation system to create exactly 10 smooth steps between each x-axis tick mark
- Coordinated x and y interpolation so dots glide smoothly in both dimensions simultaneously
- Each tick mark interval now has 10 intermediate positions with smooth value interpolation
- Both dot positioning and line generation use the same 10x interpolation system
